# Change Log

All notable changes to the "MCLI Workflow Notebooks" extension will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-28

### 🚀 Major Release: Full MCLI Command Integration!

This is a **major release** that transforms the extension from a simple notebook editor into a complete visual editing solution for all MCLI commands.

#### 🎯 Breaking Through: Auto-Format Conversion

- **Automatic format detection and conversion** - Seamlessly converts between old mcli command format and notebook format
- **Bidirectional compatibility** - Opens old format, edits visually, saves back to original format
- **Zero migration required** - Works with existing `~/.mcli/commands/*.json` files out of the box
- **Format preservation** - Maintains all metadata, structure, and compatibility with `mcli workflow`

#### ✨ What's New in 2.0

**Core Features:**
- 🔄 **Smart Format Conversion** - Automatically detects and converts old mcli command JSON to notebook format
- 💾 **Round-Trip Compatibility** - Saves back to original format when closing
- 🎨 **Visual Cell Editing** - Edit code and documentation in separate, manageable cells
- ⚡ **Live Execution** - Run Python/Shell code directly in VS Code
- 📝 **Rich Documentation** - Add markdown cells for inline documentation
- 🔧 **Metadata Preservation** - Maintains all original command metadata

**Enhanced Description:**
- Better explanation of MCLI Framework context
- Clear use cases for different audiences (DevOps, Data Science, Automation)
- Installation instructions for both framework and extension

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed crash when opening non-notebook JSON files
- Added validation and helpful error messages
- Type safety improvements

### 🎯 Why This is a Major Release:

This version fundamentally changes how you interact with MCLI commands. Instead of editing raw JSON, you now have a **visual, cell-based interface** that makes workflow creation and maintenance dramatically easier while maintaining 100% compatibility with existing workflows.

**Before v2.0:** Edit raw JSON files manually
**After v2.0:** Visual notebook interface with live execution

This is a **game-changer** for MCLI workflow development!

### 📦 Complete Feature Set (v1.0 + v2.0):

1. ✅ **Visual cell-based editing** - Jupyter-style interface
2. ✅ **Live code execution** - Python, Shell, Bash, Zsh, Fish
3. ✅ **Smart auto-conversion** - Old format ↔ Notebook format
4. ✅ **Monaco editor integration** - IntelliSense, syntax highlighting
5. ✅ **Rich markdown support** - Document your workflows
6. ✅ **Git-friendly format** - Clean JSON diffs
7. ✅ **Format preservation** - Maintains original structure
8. ✅ **Zero migration cost** - Works with existing files

### 🚀 Upgrade Path:

No action required! Simply update the extension and start using it with your existing `~/.mcli/commands/*.json` files.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-28

### 📝 Documentation Improvements

- **Enhanced description with MCLI Framework context** - Updated extension description to explain what MCLI Framework is and why you would use this extension
- **Added MCLI Framework installation guide** - New section explaining how to install and use mcli-framework PyPI package
- **Improved README** - Added "Why Use This?" section with use cases for different audiences
