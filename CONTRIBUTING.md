## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- Git
- A GitHub account

### First Time Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcli.git
   cd mcli
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment:**
   ```bash
   # Setup environment
   make setup

   # Or manually with UV
   uv venv
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

   # Configure environment variables
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash

   ```

5. **Verify your setup:**
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   ```

## Development Setup

### Environment Configuration

1. **Copy the environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Configure required variables in `.env`:**

```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We use several tools to maintain consistent code style:

- **Black** for code formatting (line length: 100)
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking
- **bandit** for security checks

### Formatting Rules

1. **Line length:** Maximum 100 characters
2. **Imports:** Use isort with black profile
3. **Type hints:** Required for public functions and methods
4. **Docstrings:** Use Google style docstrings

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import List, Optional

import click
from rich.console import Console

from mcli.lib.ui.styling import success, error


def process_items(
    items: List[str],
    filter_empty: bool = True,
    console: Optional[Console] = None
) -> List[str]:
    """Process a list of items with optional filtering.

    Args:
        items: List of string items to process
        filter_empty: Whether to filter out empty strings
        console: Optional console for output

    Returns:
        Processed list of items

    Raises:
        ValueError: If items list is None
    """
    if items is None:
        raise ValueError("Items list cannot be None")

    if filter_empty:
        items = [item for item in items if item.strip()]

    return items
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically before each commit to ensure code quality:

```bash
# Install hooks (one time setup)
make pre-commit-install

# Run hooks manually on all files
make pre-commit-run

# Update hooks
make pre-commit-update
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- **Minimum coverage:** 80%
- **Test types:** Unit tests, integration tests, CLI tests
- **Test files:** Place in `tests/` directory with `test_*.py` naming

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test-unit

# Run with coverage
make test-cov

# Run fast tests only (skip slow tests)
make test-fast

# Generate and view coverage report
make test-cov-report
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Use pytest** for all tests
2. **Mark slow tests** with `@pytest.mark.slow`
3. **Use fixtures** for common setup
4. **Test both success and error cases**

Example test:

```python
import pytest
from mcli.lib.ui.styling import success

def test_success_message():
    """Test success message formatting."""
    result = success("Test message")
    assert "Test message" in result
    assert "[green]" in result

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_integration_feature():
    """Test integration with external service."""
    # Slow integration test
    pass
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

3. **Run quality checks:**
   ```bash
   make lint
   make test-cov
   make security-check
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if needed

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `feature/*`: New features
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes
- `docs/*`: Documentation changes
- `chore/*`: Maintenance tasks

### Local Development

1. **Start with latest main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

2. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

3. **Develop with quality checks:**
   ```bash
   # Make changes
   make format  # Auto-format code
   make lint    # Check code quality
   make test    # Run tests
   ```

4. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

5. **Create pull request** on GitHub

### Release Process

1. Version bumping is handled by maintainers
2. Releases are automated through GitHub Actions
3. Changelog is maintained automatically
