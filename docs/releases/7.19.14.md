# Release 7.19.14

## Release Date
2025-11-30

## Changes

### Bug Fixes

- **fix: Suppress stdout/logging during notebook command loading** (#119)
  - Fixed unwanted output when running `mcli run` or listing commands
  - Notebook workflows were causing log spam during command loading/listing because setup cells were executing logging calls and print statements
  - Added `_suppress_output_during_loading()` context manager that suppresses stdout, stderr, and logging at INFO level and below during notebook loading
  - Output is only suppressed during loading, not during actual command execution

### Internal Changes

- Added `MCLI_NOTEBOOK_EXECUTE` environment variable constant to `EnvVars` class

## Files Changed

- `src/mcli/workflow/notebook/command_loader.py` - Added output suppression during notebook loading
- `src/mcli/lib/constants/env.py` - Added `MCLI_NOTEBOOK_EXECUTE` constant

## Upgrade Notes

No breaking changes. This is a patch release that improves the user experience when listing or discovering notebook-based workflow commands.
