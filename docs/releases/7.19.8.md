# Release Notes - Version 7.19.8

**Release Date:** 2025-11-25

## Overview

This release updates documentation to highlight MCLI's evolution into a **universal script runner** with intelligent tab completion, making the "run any script" capability more prominent.

## Documentation Updates

### 📚 Updated README

**New Branding:** "MCLI - Universal Script Runner & Workflow Framework"

**Key Changes:**
1. **New tagline:** "Run any script, anywhere, with intelligent tab completion. No registration required."
2. **Added prominent "Run Any Script - Zero Configuration" section** showcasing direct script execution
3. **Updated philosophy:** "Run first. Register later." - emphasizing zero-config script running
4. **Better positioning:** Script runner first, workflow framework second

**New README section highlights:**
```bash
# Run any script directly - no registration needed!
mcli run ./backup.py --target /data
mcli run ./deploy.sh production
mcli run ./.mcli/workflows/analysis.ipynb

# Intelligent tab completion
mcli run ./<TAB>
# Shows all files and directories, including hidden dirs like .mcli/
```

### 📦 Updated Package Description

**Previous:**
> "Portable workflow framework - transform any script into a versioned, schedulable command..."

**New:**
> "Universal script runner with intelligent tab completion. Run any Python/Shell/Jupyter script directly with mcli run ./script.py, or register as versioned workflows for scheduling and sharing."

This description now appears on:
- PyPI package page
- pip search results
- Package managers

## What Changed

### Files Modified

1. **README.md**
   - Updated title to "Universal Script Runner & Workflow Framework"
   - Added "🚀 Run Any Script - Zero Configuration" section
   - Positioned direct script execution as primary feature
   - Workflow registration as optional advanced feature

2. **pyproject.toml**
   - Updated package description to emphasize script runner capability
   - New description highlights: universal, tab completion, direct execution

## Why This Matters

**Previous positioning:** MCLI was presented primarily as a workflow framework where you register scripts.

**New positioning:** MCLI is a universal script runner that can also manage workflows.

**User journey:**
1. **Start simple:** Run any script with `mcli run ./script.py`
2. **Add convenience:** Use tab completion to discover scripts
3. **Go advanced:** Optionally register scripts as workflows for scheduling/sharing

This makes MCLI more accessible to new users while maintaining all advanced features for power users.
