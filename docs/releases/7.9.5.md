# Release Notes - Version 7.9.5

## Improvements

### Document Conversion Workflow Enhancements

#### LaTeX Package Management
- **Comprehensive Font Support**: Added `collection-fontsrecommended` to init command for complete LaTeX font coverage
- **Streamlined Installation**: Combined package collections for one-command setup
  ```bash
  sudo tlmgr install collection-latexextra collection-fontsrecommended
  ```
- **Font Database Refresh**: Automatically run `mktexlsr` after package installation to ensure fonts are available
- **Complete Package List**: Init command now includes all required packages:
  - `tcolorbox environ pgf tools pdfcol` - Color boxes and graphics
  - `adjustbox collectbox xkeyval` - Box adjustments and key-value options
  - `booktabs ulem titling enumitem soul` - Tables, underlining, title formatting, lists
  - `jknapltx rsfs` - Math fonts and symbols
  - `collection-fontsrecommended` - Comprehensive font collection

#### Temp Directory System
- **Path Safety**: All conversions now use temporary hard links in `~/.mcli/commands/temp/conversions/`
- **Special Character Handling**: Eliminates issues with spaces and special characters in file paths
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temp directories are removed after successful or failed conversions
- **Fallback to Copy**: Gracefully falls back to file copying when hard links aren't supported

#### Conversion Reliability
- **Multiple Fallback Strategies**: For Jupyter notebook → PDF conversions:
  1. `jupyter nbconvert` (most reliable for notebooks)
  2. `pandoc` with pdflatex engine
  3. `pandoc` via HTML intermediate
  4. `pandoc` default method
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Clear feedback when conversions fail with specific error details
- **Strategy Reporting**: Summary shows which conversion methods were successful

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/Users/lefv/repos/mcli/src/mcli/workflow/doc_convert.py`:
  - Enhanced init command with comprehensive LaTeX package instructions
  - Added `mktexlsr` step to font database refresh workflow
  - Implemented temp directory system with hard link support
  - Improved error handling and user feedback

### Known Limitations
- **Unicode/Emoji in LaTeX**: Jupyter notebooks containing Unicode characters (like emojis) may fail PDF conversion due to LaTeX limitations. This is a LaTeX engine limitation, not a bug in the conversion tool.
- **Workaround**: Remove Unicode characters from notebooks before conversion, or use HTML/DOCX as intermediate formats.

## Installation Notes

### For New Users
After running `mcli workflow doc-convert init`, complete the setup with:

```bash
# Install LaTeX packages and fonts (recommended)
sudo tlmgr install collection-latexextra collection-fontsrecommended
sudo mktexlsr
```

### For Existing Users
If you previously installed individual LaTeX packages, you can upgrade to the comprehensive setup:

```bash
# Install font collection for better coverage
sudo tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended
sudo mktexlsr
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Convert markdown to PDF (works perfectly)
mcli workflow doc-convert convert md pdf README.md

# Convert Jupyter notebook to PDF
# (works for notebooks without Unicode/emojis)
mcli workflow doc-convert convert ipynb pdf notebook.ipynb

# Convert with custom output directory
mcli workflow doc-convert convert md html "docs/*.md" -o ./html-output

# Batch conversion with glob patterns
mcli workflow doc-convert convert ipynb html "notebooks/**/*.ipynb"
```

## Testing

Verified conversions:
- ✅ Markdown → PDF (simple documents)
- ✅ Markdown → HTML
- ✅ Temp directory creation and cleanup
- ✅ Hard link fallback to copy
- ✅ Multi-strategy fallback system
- ✅ LaTeX font installation workflow

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. Existing `doc-convert` commands continue to work as before with enhanced reliability and better error messages.
