# Release Notes - Version 7.19.5

**Release Date:** 2025-11-25

## Overview

This release adds intelligent file path autocomplete for the `mcli run` command, making it easy to discover and execute scripts directly without registering them as workflows first.

## New Features

### 🎯 File Path Autocomplete for `mcli run`

Added intelligent shell completion for file paths when using `mcli run ./` command.

**What's New:**

- **Relative Path Completion**: Type `./` and press TAB to see all files in current directory
- **Partial Matching**: Start typing a filename (e.g., `./test_`) to filter completions
- **Directory Navigation**: Directories shown with trailing `/` for easy navigation
- **Absolute Path Support**: Works with absolute paths like `/home/user/scripts/`
- **Home Directory Expansion**: Supports `~/` for home directory paths
- **Smart Hidden File Handling**: Hidden files excluded by default, shown when explicitly requested

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Autocomplete files in current directory
mcli run ./<TAB>
./backup.py
./deploy.sh
./scripts/

# Filter by partial filename
mcli run ./test_<TAB>
./test_one.py
./test_two.py

# Navigate into directories
mcli run ./scripts/<TAB>
./scripts/backup.py
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

**Supported File Types:**

- Python scripts (`.py`) - Executed with `python`
- Shell scripts (`.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`) - Executed directly
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) - Loaded as workflow command groups
- Any executable file - Executed if executable permission set

**Implementation Details:**

- Added `shell_complete()` method to `ScopedWorkflowsGroup` class
- Intelligent path parsing to separate directory from partial filename
- Automatic hidden file filtering unless explicitly requested
- Comprehensive test coverage in `tests/unit/test_workflow_file_completion.py`

**Files Changed:**

- `src/mcli/workflow/workflow.py` - Added file path completion logic
- `tests/unit/test_workflow_file_completion.py` - Comprehensive test suite (6 tests, 100% pass rate)
- `docs/features/FILE_PATH_COMPLETION.md` - Complete feature documentation

## Testing

All tests passing:

```bash
# New file completion tests

# Result: 6 passed

# Related workflow tests

# Result: 32 passed

# Total: 38 passed, 0 failed
```
