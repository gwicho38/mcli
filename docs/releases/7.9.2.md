# Release Notes - Version 7.9.2

## Bug Fixes

### Build System Fix
- Added missing `mcli_executable.py` file required for building binary executables
- Fixed `make binary` target that was failing with "Python executable not found" error

## Technical Details

The build system expects a `mcli_executable.py` file to exist in the project root to create standalone executables. This file was missing and has been added with a proper entry point that imports and runs the main MCLI application.
