# Release 7.14.4

**Release Date**: 2025-11-15

## Overview

Patch release introducing `mcli run` as a convenient alias for `mcli workflows`, improving developer experience and aligning with existing documentation examples.

## Changes

### New Features
- **`mcli run` Command Alias**: Added `mcli run` as a shorthand alias for `mcli workflows`
  - Improves developer ergonomics with shorter syntax
  - Aligns implementation with documentation examples that already used `mcli run`
  - Maintains full backward compatibility - both commands work identically
  - Supports all flags and subcommands (e.g., `mcli run -g backup`, `mcli run secrets --list`)

### Implementation Details
- **src/mcli/workflow/workflow.py**: Added `run = workflows` alias export
- **src/mcli/app/main.py**: Registered `run` command alias in main application
  - Added in primary registration path
  - Added in fallback lazy-loading paths
  - Includes debug logging for troubleshooting

### Documentation Updates
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated Command Structure section to document the `mcli run` alias
- **README.md**: Added notes in Quick Start and Built-in Workflows sections explaining the alias
- **src/mcli/workflow/workflow.py**: Updated docstring to mention the alias

## Examples

All of these commands are now equivalent:

```bash
# Run a workflow - all three commands are identical
mcli workflows my-task
mcli run my-task

# Run with global flag
mcli workflows -g backup
mcli run -g backup

# Run with subcommands
mcli workflows secrets --list
mcli run secrets --list

# Run built-in workflows
mcli workflows pdf extract ~/file.pdf
mcli run pdf extract ~/file.pdf
```

## Why This Release?

Many examples in the README already used `mcli run` conceptually, but the alias didn't actually exist. This release makes the documentation examples work as written and provides a more ergonomic CLI experience with shorter commands.

## Migration Guide

No migration required. This is purely additive:
- Existing `mcli workflows` commands continue to work exactly as before
- New `mcli run` commands are now available as a convenient shorthand
- Choose whichever syntax you prefer
