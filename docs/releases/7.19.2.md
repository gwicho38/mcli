# Release 7.19.2

**Release Date:** 2025-11-24

## Summary

This patch release fixes the model command path to use the new workflow directory structure.

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed model_cmd.py Path
- **Issue:** `mcli lock write` showed warning "Warning: /Users/lefv/.mcli/commands/model.json not found"
- **Root Cause:** `model_cmd.py` was looking in the old `~/.mcli/commands/` directory instead of new `~/.mcli/workflows/` directory
- **Fix:** Updated path checking to first look in `~/.mcli/workflows/model.json`, then fallback to `~/.mcli/commands/model.json` for backwards compatibility
- **Impact:** Warning eliminated; `mcli lock` commands work cleanly

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `src/mcli/app/model_cmd.py` (lines 13-17)
  - Changed from hardcoded old path to new path with fallback
  - Maintains backwards compatibility

## Migration Notes

No action required. The fix automatically handles both old and new directory structures.

## Testing

- ✅ `mcli lock write` runs without warnings
- ✅ Backwards compatibility maintained for old installations

## Known Issues

None
