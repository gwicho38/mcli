# Release Notes - Version 7.19.7

**Release Date:** 2025-11-25

## Overview

This release improves the file path autocomplete feature to show hidden directories (like `.mcli`) by default, making it easier to navigate to workflow configuration directories.

## Enhancements

### 🎯 Show Hidden Directories in Tab Completion

**Issue:** When using `mcli run ./`, hidden directories like `.mcli` were not shown in tab completion, making it difficult to navigate to `.mcli/workflows/` directory.

**Previous Behavior:**
```bash
mcli run ./<TAB>
# Only showed visible files and directories
# .mcli/ was hidden
```

**New Behavior:**
```bash
mcli run ./<TAB>
# Now shows:
./README.md
./src/
./.mcli/          # ✅ Hidden directories now shown!
./scripts/
```

**Implementation:**
- Hidden **directories** are now always shown (e.g., `.mcli/`, `.git/`)
- Hidden **files** are still hidden unless explicitly requested with a dot prefix (e.g., `./.git`)
- This makes it easy to navigate to configuration directories like `.mcli/workflows/`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/mcli/workflow/workflow.py` - Updated hidden file filtering logic
- `tests/unit/test_workflow_file_completion.py` - Added test for hidden directories

## Testing

All tests passing (7 tests, including new test):
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_workflow_file_completion.py -v
# Result: 7 passed (including test_hidden_directories_shown)
```

**New Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Hidden directories are shown by default
- ✅ Hidden files are still hidden unless explicitly requested
- ✅ All previous test cases still pass

## Use Cases

This enhancement makes these workflows easier:

```bash
# Navigate to .mcli workflows
mcli run ./<TAB>
# Shows: ./.mcli/
mcli run ./.mcli/<TAB>
# Shows: ./.mcli/workflows/
mcli run ./.mcli/workflows/<TAB>
# Shows: ./.mcli/workflows/ingestion.ipynb

# Access git-related workflows
mcli run ./<TAB>
# Shows: ./.git/

# Still hides hidden files unless requested
mcli run ./<TAB>
# Does NOT show: ./.gitignore (hidden file)
mcli run ./.git<TAB>
# Shows: ./.gitignore (explicitly requested)
```
