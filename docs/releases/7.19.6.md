# Release Notes - Version 7.19.6

**Release Date:** 2025-11-25

## Overview

This is a critical hotfix release that fixes a TypeError in the file path autocomplete feature introduced in 7.19.5.

## Bug Fixes

### 🐛 Fixed shell_complete Method Signature

**Issue:** The `shell_complete` method in `ScopedWorkflowsGroup` had an incorrect signature that caused a TypeError when using tab completion with `mcli run`.

**Error:**
```
TypeError: ScopedWorkflowsGroup.shell_complete() takes 4 positional arguments but 3 were given
```

**Root Cause:** The `shell_complete` method was defined with signature `(self, ctx, param, incomplete)` but Click's Group class expects `(self, ctx, incomplete)`. The `param` argument is only used for Parameter completion, not Group completion.

**Fix:** Updated the method signature to match Click's Group interface:
```python
# Before (incorrect)
def shell_complete(self, ctx, param, incomplete):

# After (correct)
def shell_complete(self, ctx, incomplete):
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/mcli/workflow/workflow.py` - Fixed method signature
- `tests/unit/test_workflow_file_completion.py` - Updated test calls to match

## Testing

All tests passing:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_workflow_file_completion.py -v
# Result: 6 passed
```
