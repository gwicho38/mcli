## Why This Release?

This release ensures that all public-facing documentation accurately reflects the command structure changes introduced in earlier 7.14.x releases, and restores full CI/CD automation for continuous integration and deployment.

## Migration Guide

No breaking changes. This release only improves documentation and CI/CD infrastructure.

If you were following outdated command syntax from older documentation, refer to the updated README.md for correct usage:

### Correct Command Structure

**Workflow Management** (manage workflow files):
```bash
mcli commands list           # List all workflows
mcli commands import <file>  # Import workflow
mcli commands export <file>  # Export workflow
mcli commands sync           # Sync workflows to git
mcli new <name>              # Create new workflow
mcli edit <name>             # Edit workflow
mcli rm <name>               # Remove workflow
```

**Workflow Execution** (run workflows):
```bash
mcli run <workflow>          # Run local workflow
mcli run -g <workflow>       # Run global workflow
mcli run pdf extract file.pdf
mcli run scheduler add --name job --schedule "0 * * * *"
mcli run daemon start my-daemon
```

**Lockfile Management**:
```bash
mcli lock update             # Update lockfile
mcli lock verify             # Verify lockfile
```

## Installation

# Using uv (recommended)
