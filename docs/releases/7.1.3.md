## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes
1. **Fixed Plotly Deprecation Warnings**
   - Replaced deprecated `width="stretch"` with `use_container_width=True`
   - Updated all 9+ Plotly chart instances across dashboard
   - Charts now use proper Plotly configuration per 2025 standards

2. **Removed Non-Existent Readiness Module References**
   - Fixed error: `Could not import readiness directly: No module named 'mcli.app.readiness'`
   - Cleaned up `src/mcli/app/__init__.py`
   - Removed obsolete test files

3. **Fixed Non-Functional Train Models Button**
   - Previous button was just a placeholder with no functionality
   - Now triggers full training pipeline with real-time feedback
