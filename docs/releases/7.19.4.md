# Release 7.19.4

**Release Date:** 2025-11-25

## Summary

This patch release fixes async test support by ensuring pytest-asyncio is available as a core dependency.

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed Async Test Failures
- **Issue:** 16 async tests were failing with "async def functions are not natively supported" error
- **Root Cause:** `pytest-asyncio` was only in `[dev]` optional dependencies, not installed during standard test runs
- **Fix:** Moved `pytest-asyncio>=1.1.0` to main dependencies and added `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` configuration
- **Impact:** All async tests now pass correctly (20 passed, 5 skipped)

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `pyproject.toml` (line 122)
  - Added `pytest-asyncio>=1.1.0` to main dependencies
  - Added `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = "function"` to pytest configuration (line 450)

## Migration Notes

No action required. Users running tests will now automatically have pytest-asyncio available.

## Testing

- ✅ All async tests passing on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- ✅ Test suite: 20 passed, 5 skipped (async tests)
- ✅ No regressions in other test categories

## Known Issues

None
