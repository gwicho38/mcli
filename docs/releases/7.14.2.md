  - `~/.mcli/workflows/COMMAND_MAPPING.md`
  - Updated `~/.mcli/workflows/README.md`

### Command Structure Clarifications

The correct command structure is:

**Workflow Management** (manage workflow files):
```bash
mcli commands list           # List all workflows
mcli commands import <file>  # Import workflow
mcli commands export <file>  # Export workflow
mcli commands sync           # Sync workflows to git
mcli new <name>              # Create new workflow
mcli edit <name>             # Edit workflow
mcli rm <name>               # Remove workflow
```

**Workflow Execution** (run workflows):
```bash
mcli run <workflow>          # Run local workflow
mcli run -g <workflow>       # Run global workflow
mcli run pdf extract file.pdf
mcli run scheduler add --name job --schedule "0 * * * *"
mcli run daemon start my-daemon
```

**Lockfile Management**:
```bash
mcli lock update             # Update lockfile
mcli lock verify             # Verify lockfile
```

## Migration Guide
