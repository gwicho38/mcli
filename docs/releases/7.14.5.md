# Release 7.14.5

**Release Date**: 2025-11-15

## Overview

Critical bugfix release resolving an issue where the `-g/--global` flag wasn't working correctly with workflows, preventing users from accessing global workflow commands.

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed `-g/--global` Flag Not Loading Global Workflows

**Problem**: When using `mcli workflows -g` or `mcli run -g`, only built-in workflows (backup, notebook, secrets, sync) were shown, even though many global workflows existed in `~/.mcli/workflows/`.

**Root Cause**: The `ScopedWorkflowsGroup` class was filtering for workflows with `group == "workflow"` (singular), but most global workflows have `group == "workflows"` (plural) in their JSON files.

**Fix**: Updated the filter in both `list_commands()` and `get_command()` methods to accept both "workflow" and "workflows" for backward compatibility.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/mcli/workflow/workflow.py` - Updated group name filter logic

**Impact**: Users can now properly access all their global workflows when using the `-g` flag with either `mcli workflows -g` or `mcli run -g`.

## Testing

Verified fix with:
- ✅ `mcli workflows -g` now shows all 24 global workflows
- ✅ `mcli run -g` now shows all 24 global workflows
- ✅ Both commands show identical output
- ✅ Local workflows (without `-g`) still work correctly
- ✅ All workflow commands are executable

## Example

```bash
$ mcli workflows -g
