# Release 7.19.3

**Release Date:** 2025-11-24

## Summary

This patch release fixes the lockfile verification system for Jupyter notebook workflows to prevent perpetual "modified" status.

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed Lockfile Verification for Notebooks
- **Issue:** `mcli lock verify` always showed notebooks as "modified" even after `mcli lock update`, creating an infinite loop
- **Root Cause:** Notebook metadata was missing `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps, causing mismatch with lockfile entries (None != "")
- **Fix:** Extract file modification time (`st_mtime`) and creation time (`st_ctime`) from filesystem to populate timestamp fields consistently
- **Impact:** Lockfile verification now works correctly for notebooks - `mcli lock verify` returns "✓ All custom commands are verified" after `mcli lock update`

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `src/mcli/lib/custom_commands.py` (lines 121-142)
  - Added file timestamp extraction for notebooks using `Path.stat()`
  - Set `created_at` from `st_ctime` and `updated_at` from `st_mtime`
  - Added `version: "1.0"` field to notebook metadata
  - Removed unused imports (Dict, List)
  - Fixed line length issue in docstring

## Migration Notes

No action required. Existing notebooks will automatically get proper timestamps from filesystem metadata on next `mcli lock update`.

## Testing

- ✅ `mcli lock update` successfully updates lockfile with notebook timestamps
- ✅ `mcli lock verify` returns clean verification after update
- ✅ No more perpetual "modified" status for notebooks

## Known Issues

None
