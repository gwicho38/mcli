# Release Notes - Version 7.9.1

## Bug Fixes

### Import Errors Fixed
- Fixed relative import errors in ML modules that were causing `mcli-backtest` and other ML commands to fail
- Updated imports in:
  - `mcli.ml.backtesting.backtest_engine` - Fixed import of recommendation models
  - `mcli.ml.models.ensemble_models` - Fixed import of base models
  - `mcli.ml.models.recommendation_models` - Fixed imports of base and ensemble models

### Missing Entry Points Added
- Added missing `run.py` for `mcli-backtest` command
- Added missing `serve.py` for `mcli-serve` command
- Added missing `optimize.py` for `mcli-optimize` command
- Added missing `train.py` for `mcli-train` command

All ML CLI tools now have proper entry points with basic command structure:
- `mcli-backtest` - Run backtests on trading strategies
- `mcli-serve` - Serve ML models via API
- `mcli-optimize` - Optimize portfolio allocations
- `mcli-train` - Train ML models

## Technical Details

The ML module imports were using relative imports without the `mcli.ml` package prefix, causing ImportError when the commands were run as standalone scripts. All imports have been updated to use absolute imports with the full package path.
