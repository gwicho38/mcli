# Release Notes: v7.12.1

**Release Date:** 2025-11-01

## ðŸ”„ Command Reorganization

Minor release to improve command organization.

### Changes

#### Version Command Moved to Self Group

The `version` command has been moved from top-level to the `self` group for better organization:

**Old:**
```bash
mcli version
mcli version --verbose
```

**New:**
```bash
mcli self version
mcli self version --verbose
```

This aligns with the overall command structure where system management commands live under `mcli self`.

### Command Structure

The `self` group now contains all self-management commands:
```bash
mcli self
â”œâ”€â”€ version       # Show version info (moved from top-level)
â”œâ”€â”€ update        # Update mcli
â”œâ”€â”€ migrate       # Migrate configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ completion    # Manage shell completion
â”œâ”€â”€ performance   # Performance benchmarks
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard     # System dashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ hello         # Test command
â”œâ”€â”€ logs          # Log management
â”œâ”€â”€ redis         # Redis management
â”œâ”€â”€ zsh           # Zsh integration
â””â”€â”€ visual        # Visual effects
```

### Migration

No action required - both commands work:
- **Recommended:** `mcli self version` (new path)
- **Deprecated:** `mcli version` (removed)

### Files Modified

- `src/mcli/self/self_cmd.py` - Added version command and get_version_info function
- `src/mcli/app/main.py` - Removed version command

### Testing

- âœ… `mcli self version` works correctly
- âœ… `mcli self version --verbose` displays extended information
- âœ… `mcli version` correctly shows error (removed)
