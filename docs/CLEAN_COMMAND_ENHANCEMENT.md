# Enhanced Mac Clean Command - Feature Summary

## Overview

The enhanced `mcli workflow clean` command provides comprehensive Mac cleanup with special features for Flutter development and emulator management.

## Key Features

### 1. **Smart Flutter Build Management**
- âœ… Cleans old Flutter builds
- âœ… **Keeps latest Android APK** (most recent in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`)
- âœ… **Keeps latest iOS build** (most recent in `build/ios/iphoneos/`)
- âœ… Runs `flutter clean` to remove temporary build artifacts
- âœ… Scans multiple Flutter projects (`~/repos/Outlet/outlet`, `~/repos/mcli`)

### 2. **Smart Emulator/Simulator Management**
- âœ… **Keeps at least one Android emulator** (prioritizes Pixel_6_API_34_ARM)
- âœ… **Keeps one additional Android emulator** (if multiple exist)
- âœ… Removes old/unused Android emulators
- âœ… Cleans unavailable iOS simulators
- âœ… Lists remaining simulators for verification

### 3. **Comprehensive Cache Cleanup**
Cleans the following caches:
- `~/Library/Caches`
- `/Library/Caches`
- `~/Library/Logs`
- `/private/var/log`
- `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
- `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport`
- `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/watchOS DeviceSupport`
- `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode`

### 4. **Development Tools Cleanup**
Cleans caches for:
- **CocoaPods** (`pod cache clean --all`)
- **Homebrew** (`brew cleanup --prune=all`)
- **npm** (`npm cache clean --force`)
- **yarn** (`yarn cache clean`)
- **Gradle** (`~/.gradle/caches/*`)
- **pip** (`pip cache purge`)

### 5. **LSH Daemon Cleanup**
- Kills all `lshd.js` processes
- Removes socket files (`/tmp/lsh-*daemon*.sock`)
- Removes PID files (`/tmp/lsh-*daemon*.pid`)
- Verifies cleanup completion

### 6. **Git Repository Optimization**
- Runs `git gc --prune=now --aggressive` on:
  - `~/repos/mcli`
  - `~/repos/lsh`
  - `~/repos/Outlet`

### 7. **Trash Management**
- Empties macOS Trash using AppleScript
- Reports space freed

### 8. **Large File Detection**
- Scans for files > 500MB
- Searches up to 3 directory levels deep
- Displays top 10 largest files with sizes

### 9. **Space Reporting**
- Shows disk space before cleanup
- Shows disk space after cleanup
- Reports space freed for each cleanup task
- Shows total space freed at end

## Usage Examples

## Safety Features

### What's Protected
1. **Latest Android Build** - Most recent APK is preserved
2. **Latest iOS Build** - Most recent iOS app is preserved
3. **Primary Android Emulator** - `Pixel_6_API_34_ARM` is always kept
4. **At least one additional emulator** - For testing flexibility
5. **All iOS simulators** - Only "unavailable" ones are removed

### What's Cleaned
1. **Old Flutter builds** - Everything except latest APK/iOS build
2. **Temporary build artifacts** - DerivedData, caches, logs
3. **Unused emulators** - Old Android AVDs (keeping at least 2)
4. **Unavailable simulators** - iOS simulators no longer valid
5. **Development caches** - npm, yarn, Gradle, CocoaPods, Homebrew
6. **Daemon files** - LSH daemon sockets, PIDs, processes
7. **Git objects** - Unreferenced commits, pack files

## File Size Estimates

Typical space freed (depends on usage patterns):

| Category | Typical Size | Aggressive Size |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Xcode DerivedData | 5-20 GB | 20-50 GB |
| Flutter builds | 1-5 GB | 5-15 GB |
| Android emulators | 0-10 GB | 10-30 GB |
| CocoaPods cache | 500 MB - 2 GB | 2-5 GB |
| Homebrew cache | 1-3 GB | 3-10 GB |
| npm/yarn cache | 500 MB - 2 GB | 2-5 GB |
| Gradle cache | 1-3 GB | 3-10 GB |
| System caches | 2-5 GB | 5-15 GB |
| **Total Estimate** | **10-50 GB** | **50-150 GB** |

## Implementation Notes

### Code Structure
```python
clean/
â”œâ”€â”€ start (main command)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ --full (comprehensive cleanup)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ --flutter (Flutter-only)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ --emulators (emulators-only)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ --aggressive (everything)
â””â”€â”€ Helper functions:
    â”œâ”€â”€ cleanup_caches()
    â”œâ”€â”€ cleanup_flutter_builds()
    â”œâ”€â”€ cleanup_emulators()
    â”œâ”€â”€ cleanup_development_tools()
    â”œâ”€â”€ cleanup_lsh_daemon()
    â”œâ”€â”€ empty_trash()
    â”œâ”€â”€ find_large_files()
    â”œâ”€â”€ space_report()
    â””â”€â”€ git_cleanup()
```

### Key Algorithms

#### Flutter Build Preservation
1. Find all `.apk` files in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`
2. Sort by modification time (newest first)
3. Keep first (newest) APK
4. Repeat for iOS builds in `build/ios/iphoneos/*.app`
5. Run `flutter clean` (removes everything else)

#### Emulator Preservation
1. List all Android AVDs
2. Always keep `Pixel_6_API_34_ARM`
3. Keep one additional emulator (first in list)
4. Delete all others
5. Clean unavailable iOS simulators

#### Space Calculation
1. Get initial disk space: `df / | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}'`
2. Perform cleanup
3. Get final disk space
4. Calculate difference: `final - initial`
5. Format to human-readable (KB â†’ MB â†’ GB)

## Integration Points

### With Outlet Makefile
```makefile
clean-system: ## Clean system caches and build artifacts to free disk space
	@echo "ðŸ§¹ Cleaning system caches and build artifacts..."
	@bash scripts/clean_system_space.sh
```

**Replacement:**
```makefile
clean-system: ## Clean system caches and build artifacts to free disk space
	@echo "ðŸ§¹ Cleaning system caches and build artifacts..."
	@mcli workflow clean start --full
```

### With LSH Makefile
```makefile
daemon-cleanup: ## Clean up all daemon processes and files
	@echo "$(CYAN)Cleaning up LSH daemon...$(RESET)"
	@sudo pkill -f "lshd.js" 2>/dev/null || true
	# ... more cleanup ...
```

**Enhancement:**
```makefile
clean-all: clean ## Clean everything including caches
	@echo "$(CYAN)Running comprehensive cleanup...$(RESET)"
	@mcli workflow clean start --aggressive
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Docker cleanup** - Remove unused images, containers, volumes
2. **Python virtual environments** - Clean old venvs
3. **Node modules** - Remove unused node_modules directories
4. **Database dumps** - Clean old SQL/DB dumps
5. **Log rotation** - Archive old log files
6. **Duplicate file finder** - Identify and remove duplicates
7. **Unused applications** - List rarely used apps
8. **Browser cache** - Clean Safari, Chrome, Firefox caches

### Configuration File
Consider adding `~/.mcli/clean_config.json`:
```json
{
  "large_file_threshold_mb": 500,
  "max_scan_depth": 3,
  "keep_android_builds": 1,
  "keep_ios_builds": 1,
  "keep_emulators": 2,
  "auto_empty_trash": true,
  "exclude_paths": [
    "~/Documents",
    "~/Desktop"
  ]
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Deployment
1. **Dry run mode** - Preview what would be deleted
2. **Backup important builds** - Save APKs/IPAs before testing
3. **Test on non-critical machine** - Verify behavior
4. **Check emulator list** - Ensure correct emulators kept

### Test Commands
```bash
# Preview only (implement --dry-run flag)
mcli workflow clean start --full --dry-run

# Test Flutter cleanup only
mcli workflow clean start --flutter

# Test emulator cleanup only
mcli workflow clean start --emulators

# Full test with verification
mcli workflow clean start --full
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Command
Save the enhanced script to mcli commands:
```bash
# Copy to mcli commands directory
cp /private/tmp/enhanced_clean_command.py ~/.mcli/commands/clean.py

# Or use mcli to add it
mcli commands add clean --description "Enhanced Mac cleanup with Flutter/emulator management"
```

### 2. Update Makefiles
Update `~/repos/Outlet/Makefile`:
```makefile
clean-system: ## Clean system caches and build artifacts to free disk space
	@echo "ðŸ§¹ Running enhanced system cleanup..."
	@mcli workflow clean start --full
```

Update `~/repos/lsh/Makefile`:
```makefile
clean-all: clean ## Clean everything including node_modules and caches
	@echo "$(CYAN)Running comprehensive cleanup...$(RESET)"
	@mcli workflow clean start --aggressive
	rm -rf $(NODE_MODULES)
	rm -f package-lock.json
	@echo "$(GREEN)Deep clean completed âœ…$(RESET)"
```

### 3. Test
```bash
# Test basic cleanup
mcli workflow clean start

# Test full cleanup
mcli workflow clean start --full

# Verify emulators preserved
~/android-sdk/emulator/emulator -list-avds
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Permission denied cleaning caches**
```bash
# Run with sudo (be careful!)
sudo mcli workflow clean start --full
```

**Issue: Flutter clean fails**
```bash
# Ensure flutter is in PATH
which flutter

# Run from Flutter project directory
cd ~/repos/Outlet/outlet && flutter clean
```

**Issue: Emulator deletion fails**
```bash
# Check emulator path
echo $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT

# Manually delete emulator
~/android-sdk/emulator/avdmanager delete avd -n EmulatorName
```

### Debug Mode
Add `--verbose` flag to see detailed output:
```python
@clean.command(name="start")
@click.option('--verbose', is_flag=True, help='Show detailed output')
def start(full, flutter, emulators, aggressive, verbose):
    if verbose:
        logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    _start(full, flutter, emulators, aggressive)
```
