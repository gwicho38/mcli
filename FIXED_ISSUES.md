# Fixed Issues

## Makefile Issues

1. Fixed `license` format in pyproject.toml (changed from table to string format)
2. Created necessary directory structure for build process:
   - Added missing directories: db, dependencies, src/mcli/private/lpy, src/mcli/public/mcli
   - Added proper initialization files (__init__.py) 
   - Added LICENSE file with MIT license content

3. Fixed portable binary build process:
   - Updated PyInstaller call path to use venv Python instead of system Python
   - Changed from onedir to onefile for better compatibility
   - Removed problematic hidden imports 
   - Updated cache handling with proper fallbacks

4. Fixed test targets:
   - Updated test-binary target to handle errors gracefully
   - Improved test script to better identify issues

5. Added proper setup.py file for backward compatibility

6. Improved PyInstaller integration (May 2025 update):
   - Switched to using a proper spec file for better control and debugging
   - Added automatic directory creation to ensure required paths exist
   - Enhanced error reporting and diagnostic capabilities
   - Added a dedicated test script (test_pyinstaller.sh) for isolated testing
   - Fixed path resolution to correctly work with UV virtual environments
   - Properly configured onefile mode with all required resources

These changes allow all Makefile targets to work properly with the UV package manager, fixing build and installation issues.

## ERD Generation - Fixed Parameter Type Conversion (May 2025)

**Issues:** 
1. The `find_top_nodes_in_graph` function in `erd.py` was failing with the error: "slice indices must be integers or None or have an __index__ method" when generating ERDs.
2. The `generate_graph.py` module had similar issues with the error: "'>' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'" when comparing or using non-integer parameters.

**Fixes:**

1. Added validation to ensure that the `top_n` parameter is always treated as an integer before using it as a slice index in `find_top_nodes_in_graph`:

```python
try:
    top_n = int(top_n)
except (ValueError, TypeError):
    logger.warning(f"Invalid top_n value: {top_n}, using default of 5")
    top_n = 5
```

2. Added similar type validation in the `generate_graph.py` module's functions:
   - In `find_top_level_nodes`
   - In `transform_graph`
   - In `modified_do_erd`
   - In `build_hierarchical_graph`
   - In `build_subgraph`
   - In `add_nodes_and_edges`
   - In `create_dot_graph`

This ensures that when parameters like `max_depth` and `top_n` are passed as strings (which happens from command-line arguments), they're properly converted to integers before being used in comparisons or as slice indices.

**Testing:** The fix was validated using:
1. A direct test script (`test_fix.py`) that specifically tests the `find_top_nodes_in_graph` function
2. A more comprehensive test (`test_generate_graph.py`) that verifies the entire ERD generation pipeline
3. Unit tests in `test_fixed_issues.py` to verify handling of different non-integer inputs

The fix allows successfully generating ERDs from the `realGraph.json` file for the top N nodes based on descendant count.
