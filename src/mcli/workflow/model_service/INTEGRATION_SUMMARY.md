- Added MCLI service detection and fallback mechanisms
- Updated PDF processing to use AI analysis when available
- Enhanced database schema to store AI analysis results

**3. Improved Frontend Display**
- Added AI analysis indicators in the document list
- Enhanced WebSocket messages to include AI analysis
- Updated document display to show AI insights
- Added visual indicators for AI-processed documents

**4. Created Integration Tools**
- Comprehensive test script (`test_mcli_integration.py`)
- MCLI integration module for myAi (`mcli_integration.py`)
- Complete documentation and troubleshooting guide

### ✅ **Key Features**

**AI-Powered PDF Processing:**
- Automatic model selection based on system capabilities
- Document classification (legal, report, manual, financial, resume)
- Key topic extraction and complexity scoring
- Reading time estimation and summary generation

**Seamless Integration:**
- Automatic fallback to local processing if MCLI unavailable
- Real-time status updates via WebSocket
- Enhanced UI showing AI analysis results
- Database storage of AI analysis data

### 📋 **Usage Instructions**

**1. Start MCLI Service:**
```bash
mcli workflow model-service start
```

**2. Start myAi Application:**
```bash
cd ../myAi
npm start
```

**3. Upload PDFs:**
- Use the myAi interface to upload PDF documents
- Watch real-time processing with AI analysis
- View enhanced document information with AI insights

**4. Test Integration:**
```bash
python test_mcli_integration.py
```

### ✅ **New CLI Commands**

```bash
# Process PDF with AI analysis
mcli workflow model-service process-pdf document.pdf

# Process with specific model
mcli workflow model-service process-pdf document.pdf --model bert-tiny

# Extract text only
mcli workflow model-service process-pdf document.pdf --extract-only

# Start dedicated PDF service
mcli workflow model-service start-pdf-service --port 8080
```

The integration provides a powerful, AI-enhanced PDF processing experience while maintaining backward compatibility with your existing myAi workflow. The system automatically detects when MCLI is available and falls back gracefully to local processing when needed.
